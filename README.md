# FamilyBudgetController (family-budget-control)

## Short explanation about the project
This project as the primary intention the attempt of joining the Atomic Design and the Ports and Adapters Archteture (AKA Hexagonal Archteture) together, in order to make a software where the core logic is more independent of any specific front-end technology, as well and maintaining it easy for the web designers (who usually makes amazing html and styling codes) away from all the ugly logic needed to make a website work under the hood.
